Each of us<br> understands the importance<br> of joint corporate <br>events and is ready<br> to invest emotionally<br> and participate<br> in them.</p>
       <h1 class="txtnum">2</h1>
       <p class="firstprinc"><span class="rty">POLITENESS</span><br>We choose polite treatment and <br>tact because we want to respect <br>the boundaries of colleagues and<br>classmates. We prefer to use a<br>respectful form of speech with<br>each other and address ourselves<br>as “you.” Politeness for us is also<br>the ability to listen to the<br>opponent and his opposing point <br>of view, the willingness to come <br>to a win-win point without<br> conflict situations. Be polite to <br>everyone, sociable with<br> colleagues and familiar with<br> friends!</p>

       <p class="firstprinck"><span class="rty">KINDNESS</span><br>We treat each other with kindness<br> and trust, we are open and<br> generous with help and support.<br> For us, goodwill also means <br>addressing each other <br>in a comfortable manner.<br> For example, your <br>fellow students may prefer <br>to be addressed as you.</p>
       <h1 class="txtnumf">4</h1>
       <p class="firstprinc"><span class="rty">FLEXIBILITY</span><br>We live in a changing <br>world, we are adaptive<br> to changes, both small<br> and large, and are ready <br>to change our usual patterns<br> to achieve our goals. <br>We are flexible in our<br> thinking and are able<br> to think creatively<br> about problems and <br>consider different approaches<br> to solving them.
